=== Purpose of this Tutorial
This tutorial is a hands on introduction to using LAMMPS
for molecular simulations.
LAMMPS is a large Molecular Dynamics (MD) software that is broadly used in
used in Theoretical Chemistry research due to it's efficiency and broad range
of available features.
While the software is extensively documented at
link:http://www.lammps.org[lammps.org],
it can have a bit of a steep learning curve.

This tutorial is intended to smooth the learning process for new LAMMPS users
by introducing the core concepts gradually through increasingly sophisticated
simulations.
These simulations are physically motivated and will simulate phenomena
that may be familiar from an undergraduate or graduate Statistical Mechanics
course.
They are also intended to serve as a programming cookbook that can be mixed
and matched flexibly to construct more complex research simulations.
The simulations will be paired with a discussion of the key concepts
